/**
 * Which live courier price the buyer pays (z8r3fdbvdy).
 *
 * A store may now arm more than one booking provider (86eyjpv6z), and the
 * checkout fee is priced by ONE tool while dispatch may use ANOTHER. That
 * gap is a measured leak, not a hypothetical: a Lalamove-priced store
 * collected RM4.00 and the vendor then booked Delyva Instant at RM4.75,
 * eating RM0.75 on every such order.
 *
 * The fee is a PREDICTION of which tool ships, and any prediction drifts, so
 * the only real question is who absorbs the drift. We charge the HIGHER of
 * the quotes (Zaki, reconfirmed 4 Sep): whichever tool the seller picks at
 * dispatch, the collected fee covers it, and a seller who deliberately books
 * the cheaper one keeps the difference — the dispatch card shows "buyer paid
 * X" beside every price, so that choice is always informed. Min-pricing
 * would be friendlier to the buyer and would recreate exactly the leak above.
 * The over-collection is small in practice because Lalamove answers nothing
 * outside its service area: the both-quote case is the intra-city one, where
 * rider and courier prices sit close together.
 *
 * This module is PURE — the rule is the part that must never drift, so it is
 * testable without a network or a database. Fetching lives in the action.
