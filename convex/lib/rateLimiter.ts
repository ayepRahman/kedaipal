/**
 * Rate limit definitions.
 *
 * - `orderCreate`: public order creation endpoint. Keyed by retailerId so each
 *   storefront is throttled independently. Token bucket allows a burst of 5
 *   then refills at 30/min steady state.
 * - `productWrite`: authenticated retailer mutations. Keyed by Clerk subject so
 *   a single user cannot bulk-trash inventory.
 * - `addressUpdate`: public mutation that lets a shopper edit their delivery
 *   address while the order is still pending. Keyed by shortId so abuse on
 *   one order can't starve others. Token bucket allows a small burst then
 *   refills at 5/min steady state — typical edits are 1-2 per shopper.
 * - `paymentClaim`: public mutation where a shopper claims they've paid for
 *   their order. Keyed by shortId. A single shopper may legitimately re-submit
 *   if they fix the reference or replace the screenshot, so the bucket allows
 *   a small burst.
 * - `proofUpload`: public mutation that mints a one-shot Convex storage upload
 *   URL for a payment screenshot. Keyed by shortId so a single order can't
 *   exhaust the system. Slightly tighter than paymentClaim — one upload URL
 *   per claim attempt is the realistic ceiling.
