// Lalamove Open API v3 — pure client helpers (signing, payload building,
// response parsing, status normalization). NO fetch and NO Convex imports so
// every piece unit-tests in isolation; the actions in convex/lalamove.ts own
// the network + db. See docs/delivery-lalamove.md (ClickUp 86eyb5hrf).
//
// API shape (developers.lalamove.com):
//  - Base URLs per env; request/response payloads wrapped in `{ data: ... }`.
//  - Auth: `Authorization: hmac <KEY>:<TIMESTAMP>:<SIGNATURE>` where SIGNATURE
//    = hex(HMAC-SHA256("<TIMESTAMP>\r\n<METHOD>\r\n<PATH>\r\n\r\n<BODY>", SECRET)),
//    TIMESTAMP in Unix MILLISECONDS (UTC), PATH including the /v3 prefix.
//  - Quotations are honoured for exactly 5 minutes; dispatch always re-quotes.
//  - Money arrives as a decimal STRING in major units (MY: "13.5" ringgit,
//    1dp precision) — converted to integer sen at this boundary, like every
//    other money field in the repo.
