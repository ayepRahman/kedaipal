// Live courier quote for buyer-facing address surfaces (86eyb5hrf; strict
// since 27 Jul — no quote means no submit, so this state IS the gate).
//
// The reactive `delivery.quote` query only says a store is live-priced; the
// real fee comes from an ACTION, fired once per picked map pin (debounced as
// a keystroke guard). WHICH action is the store's mode, handed down as
// `providerAware`: "live" stores go through `liveQuote.quoteForCheckout`
// (every armed provider quoted, buyer pays the higher — z8r3fdbvdy) and
// not-yet-migrated "lalamove" stores keep the single-provider action, so a
// deploy alone never changes what anyone is charged. The action records the fee
// server-side and returns a row id — `orders.create` / `updateDeliveryAddress`
// load the fee from that row, so this state is display + gating only (same
// trust model as the static quote). Shared by the checkout sheet and the
// tracking page's address-edit dialog so the two can't drift.
