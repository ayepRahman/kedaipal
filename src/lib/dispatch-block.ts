 * disabled Book button and the mark-shipped prompt (86eyff02p), where it's the
 * whole explanation a rider-dispatch vendor gets before choosing to ship
 * anyway. One copy source so the two can't drift.

 * compile error here instead of silently falling through to the generic line
 * (the posture the `Locale` sweep set for exhaustive lookups).
