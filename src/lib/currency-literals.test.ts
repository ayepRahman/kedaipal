/**
 * Machine enforcement for "a store's money is rendered in the store's
 * currency" (ClickUp 86eyqgujv).
 *
 * Kedaipal sells in two countries now. A Singapore store's dashboard was
 * quoting Malaysian ringgit on its delivery fee, pickup fee, minimum-order and
 * counter-checkout price fields, because `CURRENCY_SYMBOL_OVERRIDE` was
 * module-private in `format.ts` and eleven call sites each hardcoded their own
 * "RM" prefix. Zaki hit it on a live SG store: "dont want any loose ends text
 * or whatever to still show RM or anything related to MY when they're on SG
 * store, except the currency that they selected."
 *
 * A one-time sweep does not hold — the next money input someone adds will copy
 * the nearest existing one. So the rule is a test: outside the allowlist
 * below, a seller- or buyer-facing surface may not name a currency at all. It
 * reads one from data (`retailer.currency`, `order.currency`, a `currency`
 * prop) and renders it via `formatPrice` / `currencySymbol`.
 *
 * The scan caught two sites beyond the ones the ticket listed
 * (`app.checkout.tsx`, the counter price inputs), which is the point.
 *
 * House precedent for a scan-the-source gate test: `convex-read-pattern.test.ts`
 * (adapter reads), `dependency-pins.test.ts` (package.json specs) and
 * `landing-funnel.test.ts` (forbidden copy strings).

/**
 * Surfaces that legitimately name a currency.
 *
 * Everything here prices KEDAIPAL'S OWN subscription — the landing page, the
 * pricing table, the cost calculator, the billing tab and the admin console
 * (where an operator picks the currency explicitly). Confusing the two is the
 * actual hazard: "0% cut" is Kedaipal's subscription posture, never a statement
 * about the seller's own prices.
 *
 * Note this is NOT "always MYR" any more, whatever this comment used to say:
 * Kedaipal invoices Singaporean sellers in SGD, the billing tab renders those
 * invoices, and the annual card quotes SGD yearly totals. These surfaces name a
 * currency because they name KEDAIPAL'S, resolved from `BillingCurrency`.
 *
 * Prefer NOT extending this list. `src/lib/annual-billing.ts` needed a default
 * currency and took `DEFAULT_BILLING_CURRENCY` from `convex/lib/plans.ts`
 * instead of an entry here — an allowlist entry licenses every future literal
 * in that file, not just the one you were thinking of.
 *
 * `format.ts` and the `convex/lib` currency/country tables are the definitions
 * themselves — they are where the strings are allowed to live.
