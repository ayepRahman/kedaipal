/**
 * Semantic guards on the public pricing copy (`pricing_*` teaser + `pricingpage_*`
 * full page) so the Scale repositioning (ClickUp 86eyb9zwt) can't silently rot:
 *   1. Scale is the flat multi-outlet tier — reseller-band language is dead and
 *      must not creep back in any locale.
 *   2. No tier ever advertises "Unlimited" — every allowance is finite.
 *   3. The decided order allowances (Starter 100 / Pro 200 / Scale 400) hold.
 *      Note these are display numbers from the caps ticket 86eye2ccu and
 *      deliberately lead PLAN_CAPS enforcement, so this asserts the *copy*, not
 *      the backend constant.
 * Key parity across locales is covered separately by i18n.test.ts.
