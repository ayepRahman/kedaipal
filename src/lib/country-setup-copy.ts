/**
 * Seller-facing copy for the post-switch setup checklist (86eyqgujv).
 *
 * The rule, from the ticket: **name the consequence, not the task.** Not
 * "Update payment methods" — a seller reads that as admin and skips it — but
 * "Singapore buyers can't transfer SGD into a Malaysian account, so their
 * payment will fail." The whole point of the checklist is that Zaki's worry
 * ("might cause them quite abit of problem if they use the wrong keys or
 * checkout address and buyer already made an order") is stated in the seller's
 * terms, not ours.
 *
 * Copy lives on the client and the facts live on the server — the
 * `dispatch-block.ts` split. A `Record` keyed by the union so a new checklist
 * item is a compile error here rather than a silently unlabelled row.
