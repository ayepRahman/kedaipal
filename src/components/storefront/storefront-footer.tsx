/**
 * "Powered by Kedaipal" storefront footer badge (ticket 86ey8zh3r).
 *
 * Mirrors the Store QR Poster's powered-by lockup so the printed poster and the
 * web storefront carry one uniform brand mark: a mint "POWERED BY" pill above
 * the Kedaipal wordmark. Colours + shape match `store-poster.tsx` exactly
 * (mint border #B9D9CC / mint text #7BA394 / navy wordmark lockup). Quiet by
 * design so it never competes with the retailer's own brand — the on-page twin
 * of the "Powered by Kedaipal" line on WhatsApp order confirmations. No retailer
 * toggle: universal or the loop doesn't compound.
 *
 * The `?src=powered-by` tag follows the seller-acquisition naming convention
 * (z8r3fdd1v0, src/lib/marketing-attribution.ts): the landing page captures it
 * and it rides the GA4 funnel all the way onto `retailers.signupSource`, so
 * "sellers acquired via other sellers' storefronts" is measurable. Opens in a
 * new tab so the buyer never loses the store.

			// One rhythm on every storefront page — store home, category, product
			// and checkout all render this identically. It briefly took a `compact`
			// prop for the pages ending in a bottom CTA bar, on the theory that the
			// bar's own border already separated the badge; that only held while
			// those bars were `position: sticky` and sat in flow directly under it.
			// They're `fixed` now (so the badge is ordinary page content above a
			// floating bar, exactly like the store home) and the tighter spacing
			// just read as inconsistent.
			//
			// `mt-auto` anchors the badge to the BOTTOM of the page on short
			// pages — it only works while this <footer> is a DIRECT flex child of
			// the route's `min-h-dvh flex-col` container. Don't wrap it in a
			// breakpoint div: the wrapper becomes the flex child and the margin
			// silently stops applying (that regression shipped once already).
