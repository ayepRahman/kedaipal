# Invoice & Receipt PDF Generation

**Status: implemented.** Two distinct PDF documents, plus a CSV bookkeeping
export:

- **A — Order receipt (buyer-facing):** a PDF of a shopper's order, generated
  **on demand** from the order data. The buyer self-serves it from the tracking
  page; the seller can pull it from order detail.
- **B — Subscription invoice (Kedaipal → seller):** the monthly platform-fee
  invoice. Rendered + **stored once at issue time** and downloadable from the
  billing tab (seller) and admin billing console (Kedaipal).
- **Bulk export:** the orders inbox exports the current filter (or a ticked
  selection) to **CSV** — the right tool for bookkeeping, where a stack of PDFs
  isn't.

> A **third** document now shares this pdf-lib pipeline: the parcel **despatch
> label** ([`despatch-labels.md`](./despatch-labels.md), `86eyp63mp`). It follows
> the order receipt's generate-on-demand-never-store posture, adds the only
> non-A4 page sizes in the codebase (A6 and an A4 4-up imposition), and brings
> in-repo QR + Code 128 encoders that `render.ts` draws.

## Reconciliation with the existing codebase

> **The CSV writes STORED values, deliberately (86eyrtz74).** `Order type`
> exports `storefront`, `Payment` exports `received`, `Fulfilment` exports
> `self_collect`. A CSV is read by other software as well as by people, so a
> bookkeeping formula matching `="received"` keeps working — this export has
> never changed an enum's spelling and should not start.
>
> The **table** shows the same columns worded for a person ("Storefront",
> "Paid", "Self-collect") via the registry's `display`, which is a view concern
> and stays out of `value`. If you want the pretty wording in a spreadsheet,
> that is a formatting step there, not a change here.

The ticket was drafted assuming nothing existed. In reality the **subscription
billing spine already shipped** (`86expn2qg`, [`manual-subscription.md`](./manual-subscription.md)):
the `invoices` / `subscriptions` / `billingConfig` tables, `issueInvoice`,
`myInvoices`, `markPaid`, the billing tab + admin route. So **Use Case B was ~90%
built** — the only gap was rendering a PDF of an invoice row that already exists.

We therefore did **not** create the ticket's proposed generic
`invoices(type, sellerId, pdfStorageId)` table — it would collide with the live
subscription `invoices` table. We extended the real one with a single field.

## Storage decision (why A and B differ)

| | Generated | Stored? | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| **A — order receipt** | on download | **No** | Deterministic from the order; storing a blob nobody may fetch is waste. Email/list-UI are out of scope, so an auto-stored receipt would just sit there. |
| **B — subscription invoice** | at issue time | **Yes** (`invoices.pdfStorageId`) | A financial document. `billingConfig` bank details are a mutable singleton, so regenerating later could produce *different* bytes than the seller received. Freeze at issue. |

## Code map

Pure, render-free (unit-tested):
- `convex/lib/pdf/document.ts` — money/date formatters (`formatMoney`,
  `formatDocDate`), the view-models, and the `Doc → view-model` mappers
  (`orderToReceiptData`, `invoiceToSubscriptionData`, `billingConfigToBlocks`…).
- `convex/lib/orderInboxFilter.ts` — the inbox filter predicate
  (`buildInboxPredicate`, `compareInboxOrder`), **extracted from `searchOrders`**
  so the export and the live inbox can't diverge.
- `convex/lib/orderCsv.ts` — the **column registry** (see below), RFC-4180
  escaping, and **formula-injection defense** (a field starting `= + - @` is
  prefixed `'` — every address line is buyer-typed, so this matters more since
  86eyrtz74 than it did).

### The column registry (86eyrtz74)

`ORDER_COLUMNS` is the single definition of "an order as a row": 36 entries,
each with a `key`, a `label` (used as BOTH the CSV header and the table header),
a `group` (sections the table's column picker), a `width`, and a `value(order)`
accessor. **The CSV and the dashboard table render from the same array** — the
table exists to stop sellers exporting out of habit, which only works if it
shows what the export does, and two lists would drift on the first addition.

Adding a column = one entry in that array. It appears in the CSV, in the table,
and in the column picker with no other change.

- `ordersToCsv(rows, columnKeys?)` narrows to a subset — the table's "export
  visible columns". Key resolution is **lenient**: unknown keys are dropped (a
  client on an older build must never fail an export over a renamed column) and
  an empty/absent list means every column.
- **The totals identity holds for every order shape**:
  `Subtotal + Custom work + Pickup fee + Delivery fee = Total`. Before
  86eyrtz74 there was no `Custom work` column while `computeOrderTotals` folded
  the mockup quote into `total`, so a made-to-order row silently failed to
  reconcile. The five columns are kept **adjacent** so a human can check it by
  eye, and a test pins that adjacency.
- **`Categories (current)` is a LIVE lookup**, not a snapshot — categories are
  deliberately never frozen onto an order line (see
  [`product-categories.md`](./product-categories.md)), so the cell is what those
  products are filed under *today*. Deduped and sorted across all lines, comma-
  separated. Resolved by `attachOrderCategories`, batched by distinct
  `productId` per page.
- **`orders.trackingToken` is deliberately absent**, along with internal ids,
  storage ids and the `gateway*` / `confirmationPush*` plumbing. The token is
  the capability that unlocks the buyer's no-auth tracking page and exports get
  emailed to bookkeepers; a test fails loudly if a token-derived column is ever
  added.

Rendering (pdf-lib, runs in the default Convex runtime — no `"use node"`):
- `convex/lib/pdf/render.ts` — `buildOrderReceiptPdf` / `buildSubscriptionInvoicePdf`.
  A branded letterhead layout (logo lockup top-left, document type top-right, mint
  accent rule, tinted line-item table, highlighted green total bar, bordered
  payment card, centered footer) using the slate-900/mint palette from
  `src/styles.css`. Text is sanitized to WinAnsi (standard fonts throw on
  emoji/CJK), so a non-Latin store name degrades gracefully instead of crashing.
- `convex/lib/pdf/logo.ts` — the Kedaipal brand lockup (`public/logo-2.png`)
  inlined as base64 so `embedPng` needs **no network fetch** (deterministic render
  inside the action). To refresh after a logo change, regenerate it:

  ```bash
  node -e 'const fs=require("fs");const b=fs.readFileSync("public/logo-2.png");
    const w=b.readUInt32BE(16),h=b.readUInt32BE(20);
    fs.writeFileSync("convex/lib/pdf/logo.ts",
      `export const KEDAIPAL_LOGO_PNG_SIZE = { width: ${w}, height: ${h} } as const;\n`+
      `export function kedaipalLogoPngBytes(): Uint8Array {\n\treturn Uint8Array.from(atob(KEDAIPAL_LOGO_PNG_BASE64), (c) => c.charCodeAt(0));\n}\n`+
      `const KEDAIPAL_LOGO_PNG_BASE64 =\n\t"${b.toString("base64")}";\n`);'
  ```

  To eyeball the rendered output on macOS: build a PDF to `/tmp/x.pdf`, then
  `qlmanage -t -s 1000 -o /tmp /tmp/x.pdf` produces `/tmp/x.pdf.png`.

**"How to pay" block:** bank methods print in full (one block each — actionable on
paper); QR methods can't embed the image in a text PDF, so **all** QR methods
collapse into a **single** "scan it on WhatsApp / your tracking page" pointer
(`paymentMethodsToBlocks`) — keeping the specific label for a lone QR, falling back
to a generic "Pay by QR" for several. (Previously each QR repeated the identical
pointer, which read as broken for a seller with 2+ QRs.)

**Receipt vs Invoice — one document, two faces (`86ey4fz3w`):** `buildOrderReceiptPdf`
titles itself off `OrderReceiptData.paid` (`= paymentStatus === "received"`): a
settled order prints **"Receipt"** (green "Paid" badge, "How you paid"), an unpaid
/claimed order prints **"Invoice"** (amber "Awaiting payment" badge, "How to pay",
and a footer nudging the `ORD-XXXX` payment reference). The download filename
matches (`Receipt-…` / `Invoice-…`). No separate invoice builder or table — the
pay-later counter case reuses this.

**The predicate + nouns live in ONE module** — `convex/lib/orderDocument.ts`
(`isOrderDocPaid`, `orderDocumentNoun`, `orderDocumentTitle`), imported by the
mapper, the filename, `ReceiptDownloadButton` and the counter Done-screen
actions (`z8r3fdcrzj`). Before that, all three download buttons hardcoded
"Download receipt" while the PDF titled itself "Invoice", so the invoice face —
the thing a seller chasing a corporate payment needs — was effectively
undiscoverable. **Every button label now derives from `paid`**: an unpaid order
offers "Download invoice" everywhere (seller order detail, mobile action sheet,
buyer tracking page — the buyer's copy is what they forward to whoever pays for
them).

**Seller legal identity on the "From" block (`z8r3fdcrzj`):**
`retailers.businessIdentity` — registered name, SSM/UEN (label picked by store
country via `REGISTRATION_LABEL`), a multiline billing address, tax number, and
a billing contact — prints under the store name on BOTH faces
(`businessIdentityToLines`). Every field optional; all-blank renders the legacy
one-line block byte-identically. Captured in **Settings → Store → Business
details** (directly under Business name — it's the legal half of store
identity), with copy stating outright that the fields appear on buyer
documents. **Deliberately NOT `retailers.businessAddress`** — that field is the
private radius-mode geo origin (often the seller's home, owner-only by schema
comment); this one is typed by the seller specifically to be published. It is
never added to the by-slug storefront payload (a test pins this) — it reaches a
buyer only inside a PDF their tracking token already unlocks. Because the order
document is generated on demand, identity saved *after* an order was placed
appears on that order's future downloads too — intended (the buyer document is
not a frozen financial record), same posture as a store rename.

Backend:
- **A:** `orders.generateReceiptPdf` (public action) → returns PDF bytes +
  filename. Authorized through the same `resolveSharedOrder` seam as `orders.get`:
  buyer passes `token`, seller passes an owned `shortId`.
- **A (send):** the receipt/invoice is sent to the buyer's WhatsApp as a
  ~~**`document`** attachment via the shared `deliverOrderDocument`~~ — **the
  WhatsApp delivery of this PDF was removed** (2026-08-04,
  [`86eyd63r8`](https://app.clickup.com/t/86eyd63r8)): a counter order's receipt
  was that buyer's **second** billable message, and every order now sends exactly
  one. `orders.sendOrderDocument`, `orders.sendOrderDocumentToBuyer`,
  `deliverOrderDocument` and the transient-storage dance (which existed only so
  Meta could fetch a URL) are all deleted. The document itself is unchanged and
  still generated on demand: the cashier gets **Download / Share** on the Done
  screen (`order-document-actions.tsx`), and the buyer gets a **Receipt** button
  on their order page — reached from the one confirmation message's link. Both
  call `orders.generateReceiptPdf` and get bytes directly. See
  [`counter-checkout.md`](./counter-checkout.md) and
  [`one-message-per-order.md`](./one-message-per-order.md).
- **B:** `invoices.generateInvoicePdf` (internal action, scheduled from
  `issueInvoice`) renders + stores the blob; idempotent (skips if one exists).
  `invoices.getInvoicePdfUrl` returns an ownership-checked signed URL (owning
  retailer **or** admin; `null` while still rendering).
- **B (paid receipt, `z8r3fdcrzj`):** marking an invoice paid schedules
  `invoices.generateInvoiceReceiptPdf`, which renders the SAME builder's
  **receipt face** ("Receipt" title, green Paid pill, `Paid: <date> (<method>)`
  in the dates strip, an **"Amount paid"** bar, NO payment-instructions card, a
  thank-you footer) into a **second** blob, `invoices.receiptPdfStorageId` —
  never an overwrite of the frozen invoice blob, which remains the bill the
  seller was sent. The face is **explicit opt-in**
  (`invoiceToSubscriptionData({ asReceipt: true })`), never derived from row
  status, so the legacy on-demand *invoice* render of an already-paid row still
  produces an invoice. `getInvoiceReceiptPdfUrl` /
  `getOrCreateInvoiceReceiptPdfUrl` mirror the invoice pair (same ownership
  gate; on-demand covers rows paid before this shipped); the generator refuses
  anything not `paid`, so pending/void rows can never mint one. Surfaced as a
  second icon button on **paid** rows of the billing tab's invoice history.
  (The admin console's invoice list is pending-only, so it has nowhere to show
  a receipt — admins reach one via act-as if ever needed.)
- **CSV:** `orders.exportOrders` (**action**) — same filter args as
  `searchOrders` (via the shared predicate), or an explicit `orderIds` selection.
  Unlike the reactive inbox (capped at a 1000-doc scan), the export **paginates
  the full result set** in 500-row pages via the internal `exportPage` query, so
  a bookkeeping export is never silently truncated to the latest 1000 orders. A
  hard `EXPORT_SCAN_CAP` (20,000 docs ≈ 10 months at the Scale tier) bounds the
  worst case and is surfaced as a `capped` flag — the inbox warns the seller
  ("Exported the latest N … narrow the date range") rather than returning
  silently-incomplete books. Returns `{ csv, count, capped }`. An action (not a
  query) because it's a one-shot file generation, not a subscription.
  Takes an optional `columnKeys` (the table's visible set) and `showPinned`,
  which is passed in lockstep with the inbox so the CSV holds exactly the rows
  the seller was looking at — forced-in pins included. Rows come back
  **pinned-first**, the same order the inbox shows, and the `Pinned` column
  keeps those rows identifiable once the file is open in Excel.

Frontend:
- `src/components/order/receipt-download-button.tsx` — used by the seller order
  detail (`shortId`) and the buyer tracking page (`token`).
- `src/components/order/order-document-actions.tsx` — the counter Done-screen
  Download / Share block (`sharePdfBytes` + `canSharePdf` in
  `src/lib/download.ts` drive the OS share sheet, falling back to download).
  Renamed from `send-order-document.tsx`, and the Send-to-WhatsApp button is
  gone, when `86eyd63r8` cut the order to one outbound message — see
  [`counter-checkout.md`](./counter-checkout.md).
- `src/components/settings/invoice-download-button.tsx` — used by the billing tab
  and admin billing console.
- `src/lib/download.ts` — `downloadPdfBytes` / `downloadCsv` (CSV gets a UTF-8 BOM
  so Excel reads non-ASCII).
- Orders inbox (`app.orders.index.tsx`) — an **Export CSV** button (label becomes
  "Export N" when rows are selected).

## Discoverability

Every surface is a visible button where the document is relevant — the seller's
order detail + inbox, the buyer's tracking page, the billing tab, and the admin
console. A just-issued invoice's button toasts "still being prepared" for the few
seconds before the async render lands, rather than failing silently.

## Schema

Additive optional fields only (`convex/schema.ts`, dev-only widen, no backfill):

```ts
// invoices
pdfStorageId: v.optional(v.id("_storage")),
receiptPdfStorageId: v.optional(v.id("_storage")), // paid receipt (z8r3fdcrzj)

// retailers — legal identity for buyer documents (z8r3fdcrzj)
businessIdentity: v.optional(v.object({
	legalName: v.optional(v.string()),
	registrationNumber: v.optional(v.string()), // SSM (MY) / UEN (SG)
	address: v.optional(v.string()), // multiline, paper-only
	contact: v.optional(v.string()),
	taxNumber: v.optional(v.string()), // printed string, no tax behaviour
})),
```

## Out of scope (tracked separately)

Email delivery of invoices/receipts; a dedicated invoice-list UI; payment
reconciliation; SST/tax compliance (LHDN MyInvois e-Invoice included —
`businessIdentity.taxNumber` is a printed string with no behaviour); sequential
per-retailer invoice numbering on buyer documents (they reference `ORD-XXXX`;
a gapless series is a compliance feature to build alongside tax).
