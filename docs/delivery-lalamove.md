# Lalamove Delivery — checkout quote, one-tap dispatch, auto tracking

ClickUp [`86eyb5hrf`](https://app.clickup.com/t/86eyb5hrf) · shipped Jul 2026 (dev) · Fruit Hut (Founding #4) is the launch seller.

End-to-end delivery fulfilment on the Lalamove Open API v3 (market MY): the
buyer pays the **real rider price** at checkout, the seller books the rider in
**one tap** from order detail, and the webhook drives `shipped` (with live
tracking link) and `delivered` automatically. No manual tracking handling
anywhere.

## Locked decisions

- **BYO-ONLY money model** (Arif, revised 21 Jul — supersedes the 18 Jul
  "master fallback" plan): the seller holds their own Lalamove Business
  account; their API key/secret live on the retailer and they pay Lalamove
  directly from their own prepaid wallet — mirroring the retailer-owned
  payment-gateway posture. **Kedaipal has no Lalamove account and never
  books or pays on a seller's behalf.** A seller without their own keys
  simply uses the flat/radius pricing modes and books riders however they
  do today. (The briefly-built master fallback — env keys, RM2k spend cap,
  billing-tab meter, admin rebill badge — was removed the same day; see git
  history if it's ever wanted back.)
- **Fee frozen at checkout; dispatch always re-quotes.** Lalamove honours a
  quotation for exactly 5 minutes, so the buyer-paid fee and the actual
  booking cost are different numbers by design. Drift is absorbed by the
  paying account and stored on the job row (`costActual`), never rewriting
  the order. The dispatch confirm dialog shows the variance before booking.
- **Provider is a seam.** `deliveryJobs.provider` is a literal union of one
  today; the client is one module; DelyvaX is the named provider-#2
  candidate (trigger: parcel couriers or courier choice).
- **Pro-gated** (`PLAN_FEATURES.delivery`): enabling booking + switching
  pricing to live-quote are Pro; disabling/clearing stays un-gated
  (downgrade never traps); buyer-side fee rendering is all-tier.

## Architecture

**No new field for the origin** — the ticket's `retailers.deliveryOrigin`
was stale: `retailers.businessAddress` (shipped with radius delivery,
86extzdr8) is already the seller's pinned origin and is reused as the
Lalamove pickup point. One address, two consumers.

Pricing rides the existing delivery-charge seam: `deliveryConfig` gained a
third arm `{ mode: "lalamove", onUnquotable }` next to `flat`/`radius`, all
resolved by the same pure `resolveDeliveryQuote` (`convex/lib/delivery.ts`).
**`onUnquotable` is VESTIGIAL since 27 Jul** (Zaki): lalamove mode always
behaves as block — see "No fee-pending under Lalamove" below; the field stays
so stored rows validate and `sanitizeDeliveryConfig` normalizes it to
`"block"` on save. **Pricing and booking are orthogonal**: a seller can
charge a flat fee yet still book riders (absorbing drift); live-quote
pricing additionally requires booking to be enabled (its vehicle +
credentials price the quote).

**No KEDAIPAL distance limit under Lalamove — by construction.** The pricing
modes are mutually exclusive, and the `lalamove` arm of
`resolveDeliveryQuote` never reads the radius bands, the business-address
distance, or any range cap of ours — we impose no delivery area. Raised by
Zaki 26 Jul ("Lalamove can deliver anywhere") — audited: nothing to disable
on our side. The settings copy SAYS so ("no delivery area to set…") and the
By-distance card is subtitled "Radius bands — you deliver" so the two modes'
mental models don't blur.

**But LALAMOVE has one — it's a city zone, not a radius, and it is the SAME
for every vehicle (27 Jul, measured live).** Lalamove is an intra-city
courier: both stops must sit inside one serviceable city zone
(`GET /v3/cities` for MY lists `KUL`, `JHB`, `MKZ`, `NTL`), or the quote is
refused with HTTP 422 `{"errors":[{"id":"ERR_OUT_OF_SERVICE_AREA"}]}`.
Head-to-head from a **Beranang, Selangor** origin (MY sandbox):

| Destination | ~Distance | MOTORCYCLE | CAR |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Seremban | 42 km | RM 21.20 | RM 33.10 |
| Port Dickson | 77 km | out of service area | out of service area |
| Melaka City | 105 km | out of service area | out of service area |
| Alor Setar | 400 km | out of service area | out of service area |

Three conclusions that shaped the build:

1. **Vehicle ≠ range.** Bike and car share one coverage boundary — the city
   config differentiates them by dimensions/load only (10 kg vs 40 kg). So
   Zaki's proposed "bike failed → re-quote with car" fallback was
   investigated and **deliberately not built**: it can never rescue an
   out-of-zone address. Vehicle choice is parcel size + price, full stop.
2. **Cross-zone is refused even between two Lalamove cities** — Melaka is a
   served city (`MY MKZ`), yet Beranang (KUL zone) → Melaka fails. The rule
   is "same zone", not "near a Lalamove city".
3. **No km number can honestly be published** (the KUL edge sits somewhere
   in the 42–77 km band from Beranang and differs by direction/origin), so
   the UX never promises a range — the live quote answers, and the refusal
   is made legible.

**Buyer-facing failure taxonomy** — `classifyQuoteFailure` (pure,
`convex/lib/lalamove.ts`, unit-tested against the real captured 422 body)
maps every quotation failure onto three stories, because only one is
retryable:

| Status | Trigger | Buyer sees | Retry helps? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `out_of_range` | `ERR_OUT_OF_SERVICE_AREA` / `ERR_INVALID_MARKET` | "This address is too far — our delivery rider service doesn't cover it. Try an address closer to {store}[, or choose pickup]." | Never — change address |
| `store_unavailable` | HTTP 401/403 (revoked/typo'd seller key) **or** missing creds/pickup pin at quote time | "Delivery pricing isn't working for this store right now — it's on {store}'s side, not yours. [Choose pickup, or] message the store on WhatsApp." | Never — seller must fix |
| `unavailable` | Everything else (5xx, network, odd payloads, our rate limit) | "We couldn't calculate the delivery fee right now — re-pick your address to retry, or try again shortly." | Yes |

All three block submit (strict quote-or-refuse); `no_coords` (no pin picked)
keeps its own "pick a suggestion" line. The address-edit dialog carries the
same taxonomy. Coverage refusals are NOT logged as errors (expected business
outcome); broken-store and transient failures are. **Expectation is set up
front**, not just at the wall: the delivery-address field on a live-quote
store shows "Delivery is by rider, so the fee depends on your address…
Addresses outside the rider's coverage can't be delivered", and the
**seller's settings panel** now teaches the same rule from their side (city
zone around the pickup point, ~40–70 km, never cross-zone, vehicle doesn't
change it, keep self-collect on as the fallback).

**No fee-pending under Lalamove — strict since 27 Jul (Zaki).** A seller who
picked Lalamove must never be handed fee homework, and the buyer must always
see the real rider price before sending. So under lalamove pricing there is
NO "arrange" fallback anywhere: checkout requires a pinned, quotable address
(no pin / no quote → submit disabled with reason; `orders.create` enforces
the same), and the tracking page's **address edit** fetches a fresh live
quote for the new pin — the buyer sees the new fee before saving, the dialog
passes the quote row id to `updateDeliveryAddress`, and an unpriced edit is
refused. Shared client hook: `src/lib/use-live-delivery-quote.ts` (checkout
sheet + edit dialog, one debounce/seq/trust model). Accepted trade-off: a
Lalamove/API outage or broken key refuses delivery checkout on that store
until it recovers (copy says "try again shortly"; self-collect unaffected).
The seller card's `orders.deliveryFeePendingReason` (`out_of_range` |
`no_coords` | `unquotable`, 26 Jul) still drives reason-true copy — under
lalamove the `unquotable` reason is now **legacy-only** (rows from before
the strict rule). See
[`fulfilment.md`](./fulfilment.md#fee-pending-arrange-via-whatsapp--the-second-payment-hold).

Schema: `retailers.deliveryBooking { enabled, vehicleType, apiKey?, apiSecret?, apiKeyHint? }`
(**encrypted at rest since 86eyn25gk** — the hint is stamped at save from the
plaintext; see [`docs/credential-encryption.md`](./credential-encryption.md)),
`deliverySnapshot`
gains mode `"lalamove"` + `quotationId`/`vehicleType`/`quotedAt` audit
fields, and two new tables: `deliveryQuotes` (transient server-side checkout
quote record) and `deliveryJobs` (the booking ledger — indexes `by_order`,
`by_retailer`, `by_provider_order`).

### Credential resolver

`resolveLalamoveCredentials(booking)` — the seller's own key pair on the
retailer row is the ONLY source; absent/half → `null` (feature unavailable,
checkout falls back gracefully). **No per-seller env vars** — sandbox vs
production is inferred from Lalamove's own key prefix (`pk_test_…` →
sandbox, else production), so a key can never be pointed at the wrong API
host and one store can run sandbox keys while another runs prod. Since
86eyn25gk the stored pair is **encrypted at rest**: the sync resolver is a
presence check only, and `callLalamove` decrypts via
`decryptLalamoveCredentials` (re-inferring env from the PLAINTEXT key) right
before every request — see
[`docs/credential-encryption.md`](./credential-encryption.md).
`updateSettings` enforces: enabling requires business address + both key
parts; half a credential is refused at save time; clearing keys while
enabled is refused (nothing to fall back to); key fields follow the
logoStorageId convention (`undefined` = keep stored, `""` = clear).

**Settings prominence (24 Jul):** the delivery-charge picker is a 2×2
card grid with **Lalamove first** — branded with the official wordmark
(`public/img/lalamove-logo.svg`) ahead of Free/Flat/By-distance. For a
locked Starter the card stays **full-colour with a Pro chip + "upgrade to
Pro to turn on"** (disabled-with-reason, deliberately not a washed-out
ghost) so every tier sees rider delivery exists — the upsell surface for
the Pro tier. The settings vehicle is labelled as a *default* with a
helper noting the per-order switch in the booking dialog. Every mode card
(and the vehicle picker) carries a **radio-style corner dot** (`ModeRadioDot`,
27 Jul) — empty ring vs filled accent dot — because the tinted-border
selected state alone read as "these might all be on" when the grids in fact
choose exactly one option.

**IA (revised after first seller test):** Lalamove is NOT a separate card —
it's the 4th delivery-pricing mode (Settings → Fulfilment → Delivery charge:
Free / Flat / By distance / **Lalamove**). Picking it reveals the whole
setup inline — pickup address, vehicle, BYO keys (with a "How to set up"
link to the vendor guide at `/guides/lalamove-setup.html`) and, once keys
are saved, the deployment's **webhook URL with one-tap copy** (see Webhook
below). One save button writes `deliveryConfig` + `deliveryBooking`
together; switching to another pricing mode disables booking in the same
save (keys stay stored, so switching back is instant). The key inputs are
plain text with a CSS mask on the secret — deliberately NOT
`type="password"`, so Chrome never mistakes the form for a login and
autofills saved credentials into it.

### Checkout quote (trust model)

The reactive `delivery.quote` query answers `{ kind: "live" }` for
lalamove-mode stores; the client (checkout page + address-edit dialog, via
the shared `useLiveDeliveryQuote` hook) then calls the
`lalamove.quoteForCheckout` **action** once per picked address AND per
chosen date (debounced,
rate-limited per retailer — the quote-by-coordinates oracle gets the same
trilateration caution as the radius quote). The action records the fee in a
`deliveryQuotes` row and returns `{ quoteId, fee }`; **`orders.create` only
ever accepts the row id** — coordinate-matched (±~11 m), ≤30 min old,
consumed on use — so the browser can display the fee but never dictate it.
Missing/stale/mismatched quote → **checkout refused** with clear copy
(strict, 27 Jul — no quote, no order; see "No fee-pending under Lalamove"
above). Kill switch: no credentials/config → the quote query never says
"live" and checkout behaves exactly as before.

**Pre-orders are priced for THEIR moment (23 Jul; exact time since 4 Aug):**
checkout now captures a fulfilment TIME alongside the date
(`orders.fulfilmentTimeMinutes` — see docs/fulfilment-date.md), so the quote
is requested with Lalamove `scheduleAt` = the buyer's exact chosen moment.
Changing the date OR the time re-quotes exactly like changing the address.
Orders without a time (legacy, or a cleared field) keep the old noon-MYT
day heuristic byte-for-byte. One pure rule decides both here and at
dispatch — `resolveScheduleAt` (`convex/lib/lalamove.ts`): a moment ≥30 min
ahead and within ~30 days schedules; anything past, imminent or absurd
books "now" — so the fee the buyer paid and the trip the vendor books can
never be priced for different moments.

Note: a buyer address edit (`updateDeliveryAddress`) re-prices through the
same resolver. Under lalamove pricing the edit dialog fetches a **fresh
live quote for the new pin** (mutations can't fetch, so the dialog does —
same hook/trust model as checkout) and passes `deliveryQuoteId`; the buyer
sees the new fee before saving, and an unpriced edit is refused (27 Jul —
supersedes the earlier lands-fee-pending behavior).

### Dispatch (Book delivery)

**When can the vendor book?** From the FIRST in-progress status onwards:
`confirmed` or `packed` (custom seller stages ride on these canonical
anchors, so a store's own stage names change nothing). Pending orders can't
book (order not accepted yet); shipped/delivered/cancelled can't (rider
already moving or moot). Pre-order / mockup flows therefore work exactly as
expected: the vendor books whenever THEY are ready — after design approval,
after payment, on the morning of the fulfilment date — manually, or lets
auto-book fire on packed+paid+due-today.

Two-tap: `prepareBooking` re-quotes and the confirm dialog
shows it against the buyer-paid fee (variance called out, including who
absorbs it). **The booking defaults to the buyer's chosen moment (4 Aug):**
when the order carries a fulfilment date+time still ≥30 min ahead, the
quotation is prepared with `scheduleAt` = exactly that, the dialog says
"Scheduled pickup — the rider comes 4 Aug · 3:30 PM", and the job row
records `deliveryJobs.scheduledAt` so the card reads "Scheduled pickup —
3:30 PM" instead of sitting on "Finding rider" for hours (Lalamove assigns
a driver closer to the time). A past or imminent moment books NOW — the
buyer's ask is already due — and the dialog says that instead. Timeless
orders behave exactly as before. Same two-tap, same variance rules **with a per-order vehicle switch** (Motorcycle ⇄ Car,
defaulted to the settings vehicle; switching re-quotes since prices are
per-vehicle — a bulky one-off order gets a car without a round-trip to
Settings, and the chosen vehicle is what lands on the ledger row); `confirmBooking` places the order within the 5-minute window
and writes the `deliveryJobs` row — the **one-active-job-per-order**
invariant is enforced by a **reserve → POST → commit** sequence (PR #127
review): `reserveBooking` atomically claims the slot with a placeholder
row (no `providerOrderId` yet) BEFORE the external `POST /v3/orders`, so
two concurrent confirms — even with distinct quotations from phone +
desktop — can never both dispatch a rider; the loser is rejected before
any money moves. `commitBooking` finalizes with Lalamove's order id, a
failed POST releases the reservation into the amber rebook card, and a
5-minute scheduled sweep expires a reservation orphaned by a crash
mid-call (copy points the seller at their Lalamove app, since in the
crash-mid-POST case the rider order may exist there untracked). Every blocked state renders disabled-with-reason on the
card (`DispatchBlock` map): wrong status, no map pin on the address (with a
fix path — never a dead end), booking off, plan gate (Pro chip), no
credentials, missing buyer/seller phone.

**`country_unsupported` is the exception that renders nothing at all** (SG-lite,
`86eyqgujv`). It is checked FIRST — ahead of even `not_delivery` — because
every other reason names a fix, and in a market our integration doesn't serve
there is no fix to name. Before it, a store switched MY→SG fell through to
`no_seller_phone` and told the seller to *"add a Malaysian (+60) WhatsApp
number in Settings → Store"*, which the country switch itself refuses to store:
a closed loop. The card now returns null, including when a completed or failed
Malaysian trip is on the order — that history belongs on the order timeline
rather than under a live dispatch card that would re-offer a booking.

**Except while a rider is still out** (PR #221 review). `cancelBooking` carries
no country gate of its own, so hiding the card on a just-switched store would
leave a seller with a trip in flight unable to stop one they are *being billed
for* — a pure UI trap, and the exact shape of trap the country-switch work
exists to remove. An in-flight card on an unsupported country renders tracking
and Cancel and nothing else: the booking controls are gated on `!activeJob`
independently, so nothing there can spend.

`getDeliveryJob.bookingEnabled` agrees with the block reason, so the mark-shipped
prompt hands an SG seller the courier + consignment form instead of a rider
prompt. Enabling `deliveryBooking` at all now runs the same country allowlist
in `updateSettings` — previously that rule only bound a store while it was
*switching*, so an already-SG store could arm rider booking with nothing in its
way.

That copy lives in
`src/lib/dispatch-block.ts` (`dispatchBlockCopy`) because the **mark-shipped
prompt** renders the same reasons — a rider vendor is never offered the manual
parcel-courier form, so this copy is their whole explanation before they choose
to ship without a rider (ClickUp `86eyff02p`, see
[`fulfilment.md`](./fulfilment.md#seller-ux)). That prompt is now the
**blocked-only** surface for them: when a rider *can* be booked, advancing the
order by hand opens this card's own booking dialog instead (4 Aug — one modal,
one price, one vehicle switch), with a `Mark as {stage} without a rider` action
inside it for the order going out another way. Wallet-empty
booking failures surface Lalamove's error as "top up your Lalamove wallet,
then retry". `cancelBooking` (with a rider-fee warning) deliberately skips
the eligibility gates — cancelling must work even when booking wouldn't.

### Prompt to book on packed (opt-in)

Zaki's ask after weighing silent auto-book: don't spend the vendor's wallet
without them seeing the price. So there is **NO server-side auto-booking**.
Instead, `retailers.deliveryBooking.promptBookOnPacked` (opt-in toggle in the
Lalamove setup) makes the order page **auto-open the Book-delivery confirm
dialog** (today's re-quoted price + variance vs buyer-paid) the moment the
seller marks a **paid, due-today** delivery order **Packed** — one tap to
dispatch, or dismiss. Nothing books or charges until the seller confirms.

Client-side, in `BookDeliveryCard`: an effect watches for a live transition
INTO `packed` (a page load of an already-packed order never prompts — the
status is baselined first), then gates on promptBookOnPacked + payment
received + not future-dated + no active job + bookable (blockReason null),
and calls the same `prepareBooking` the manual button uses. Future-dated
(pre-order) and unpaid orders never prompt; the card's ⚡ hint tells the
seller what to expect. Scoped to the order-detail page — bulk/inbox packing
doesn't fire the dialog (no modal-spam). This replaced the briefly-built
silent auto-book (`autoBookForOrder`/`getAutoBookContext`, removed) — see
git history if a zero-tap option is ever wanted for high-volume sellers.

### Phones — Lalamove MY only accepts +60

Lalamove validates the rider-contact area code per market (a +65 buyer
422'd in testing — real JB cross-border case). `toLalamoveMyPhone`
normalizes to `+60…` or returns null: a non-MY **buyer** number falls back
to the seller as rider contact (buyer's real number in the rider remarks;
the confirm dialog says so up front), while a non-MY **seller** number
blocks dispatch with "add a Malaysian (+60) WhatsApp number in Settings →
Store". `friendlyBookingError` names phone rejections honestly if one ever
slips through.

### Webhook

`POST /webhook/lalamove` mirrors the WhatsApp route: raw body → resolve
secrets → verify → act → ack. Lalamove-specific twists:

- Auth lives **inside the JSON body** (`apiKey`/`timestamp`/`signature`),
  and the verifying secret is **per retailer** (BYO-only): the route
  resolves it through the `deliveryJobs` row (`by_provider_order`) — the
  job retailer's stored secret is the only candidate. Unmatched events are
  unverifiable by design and get ack+ignore.
- **Signature formula CONFIRMED against real sandbox traffic (21 Jul 2026)**:
  `hex(HMAC-SHA256("<ts>\r\nPOST\r\n<our-path>\r\n\r\n" + JSON.stringify(data), secret))`
  — the `data` variant. An `envelope` fallback candidate is kept
  defensively; the route logs which variant matched.
- Lalamove retries 10× over 24 h **and disables the URL after 10 failures**,
  so every handled-or-ignorable outcome acks 200 (including the empty-body
  registration ping). 401/500 are reserved for forged/misconfigured cases.
- Events arrive **out of order** and can **regress** (a matched driver
  bailing sends the order back to `ASSIGNING_DRIVER`). The job row follows
  provider truth via a `lastEventAt` guard; the **order never regresses** —
  `picked_up` → `shipped` only from confirmed/packed, `completed` →
  `delivered` only from confirmed/packed/shipped, cancelled orders are never
  touched, and transitions ride the exported `applyStatusTransition` so stage
  vocabulary, activation stamping and orderEvents all come free. (It used to
  carry a WhatsApp notify too — removed by `86eyd63r8`; see the note under the
  event table.)
### Event-by-event: when it fires, what we do, who is told

| Event | When Lalamove sends it | What we do | Vendor sees | Buyer sees |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `ORDER_STATUS_CHANGED: ASSIGNING_DRIVER` | booking placed / driver bailed and rematching | job pill | "Finding rider" on the order card (live) | nothing — matching churn is noise |
| `DRIVER_ASSIGNED` | a driver accepted | driver name/phone/plate + shareLink onto the job; link mirrored to `orders.carrierTrackingUrl` (fill-if-unset) | driver row + Call + Live tracking on the card | nothing yet — deliberate: drivers can still bail; the buyer promise starts at pickup |
| `ORDER_STATUS_CHANGED: ON_GOING` | driver is **heading to the VENDOR** to collect (not to the buyer yet) | job pill | "Rider on the way" (to *you*) | nothing |
| `ORDER_STATUS_CHANGED: PICKED_UP` | rider has the goods, now heading to the buyer | **order → `shipped`** via `applyStatusTransition` (which also drops a stale `currentStageId` — see note below) | inbox/status flips reactively + orderEvents row | order page flips to Shipped and the **live-tracking link appears** on it — reactively, no message (`86eyd63r8`) |
| `ORDER_STATUS_CHANGED: COMPLETED` | goods handed to the buyer | **order → `delivered`** | inbox/status flips reactively + timeline row (no chime — see note); the dispatch card settles to a green **Delivered** summary — booking cost (seller's actual spend), rider name/plate, and a "Trip details" link — never an empty card | order page flips to Delivered — no message (`86eyd63r8`) |
| `ORDER_STATUS_CHANGED: EXPIRED` | no driver found in Lalamove's matching window | job → failed + reason | **email** (`deliveryJobFailed`) + **browser alert** + amber card + one-tap Rebook | nothing (order unchanged — buyer was never told a rider existed) |
| `ORDER_STATUS_CHANGED: CANCELED / REJECTED` | booking cancelled (by vendor on Lalamove's side, by Lalamove, or step 1 of a clone) | job → failed + reason | same failure surfaces as EXPIRED | nothing |
| `ORDER_AMOUNT_CHANGED` | **after** matching/completion when the final charge differs from the quote — waiting-time fees, priority fee/tip added, toll adjustments | `costActual` updated on the job | the card's "Booking cost" updates reactively (the drift ledger vs buyer-paid fee) | nothing — buyer price is frozen |
| `ORDER_REPLACED` | Lalamove's **cancel-and-clone**: for post-match adjustments THEY cancel the original and re-create it under a new orderId (sequence: CANCELED old → ORDER_REPLACED → clone's own events) | job repointed to the new id, **revived** to "assigning", stale failure cleared | card returns to active; if the clone-cancel briefly emailed a failure, the booking visibly recovers (rare, self-healing) | nothing |
| `POD_STATUS_CHANGED` | rider uploaded the drop-off photo / signature | trigger only — the truth is read from `GET /v3/orders` by the idempotent `fetchPodImages` (also scheduled at COMPLETED, whichever lands first wins; the loser's blobs are cleaned) | photo thumbnails on the delivered dispatch card | **"Delivery photo" card on the order page** — page-only (`86eyd63r8`) |
| `WALLET_BALANCE_CHANGED` | vendor wallet balance moved | logged only (proactive low-balance banner = named follow-up) | — | — |
| `ORDER_CREATED` (undocumented but real) | at booking | logged only | — | — |

**Proof of delivery (POD) — rider drop-off photo:** every placed order
requests POD (`isPODEnabled: true` in `buildPlaceOrderBody` — free, and
the photo is the seller's evidence in "never arrived" disputes). On
completion (`COMPLETED` and/or `POD_STATUS_CHANGED` — both trigger the
same idempotent fetch) `lalamove.fetchPodImages` reads
`GET /v3/orders/{id}` → `stops[].POD {status, image, deliveredAt}`, keeps
`DELIVERED`/`SIGNED` stops with an image, downloads the shots and stores
them as **our** blobs (`deliveryJobs.podImageStorageIds` — Lalamove's URL
lifetime is undocumented, never hotlink), retrying up to 3× at 2-min
intervals since the upload can lag the status event. Then: the **buyer**
sees a "Delivery photo" card on their order page (`orders.get` resolves
`podImageUrls` on delivered delivery orders only — one indexed read on
that end-state, the hot tracking path pays nothing), and the **vendor**
sees thumbnails on the delivered dispatch card ("Delivery photo from the
rider… the buyer sees this on their order page", tap for full size).

**POD photos are page-only since [`86eyd63r8`](https://app.clickup.com/t/86eyd63r8).**
`whatsapp.notifyDeliveryPhoto` — the WhatsApp follow-up that used to carry
these shots to the buyer ("Delivered! 📸 …", EN+BM) — is **deleted**. It was
the one send in the codebase that produced **N messages from a single event**
(up to 3 images, one send each), which is exactly the shape that stops being
affordable when Meta bills per delivered message from 1 Oct 2026. The order's
one WhatsApp went out at confirmation; the photo lands on the page that
message linked to. `fetchPodImages` still downloads and stores the blobs
identically — only the send was removed. See
[`one-message-per-order.md`](./one-message-per-order.md). Races are settled in `storePodImages` (first
set wins, loser's blobs deleted); order/account delete cascades remove the
blobs. Sandbox never produces a POD (no riders), so the photo path is a
**first-prod-booking check**; all parsing/storage/race logic is
unit-tested.

**Stage-pointer consistency (bug found in live testing, 24 Jul):** a seller
tapping the stepper stores BOTH `orders.status` and `orders.currentStageId`;
webhook transitions previously advanced only `status`, so the stored stage
pinned the tracking page + order detail back to "Packed" on a delivered
order (display resolves stage-first). Fixed at both layers:
`applyStatusTransition` now clears a stale `currentStageId` on any real
status change (same-status replays keep within-anchor custom stages), and
`resolveCurrentStage` (both `convex/lib` + `src/lib` mirrors) ignores a
stored stage whose anchor is BEHIND the canonical status — which also heals
any already-stale rows with no migration.

**Why only PICKED_UP and COMPLETED move the order:** those are the two
promises a buyer cares about ("your food is moving" / "it arrived"), and
they're irreversible. Everything earlier (matching, assignment, rider
heading to the stall) can churn — flipping the order on it would show the
buyer false-starts. This reasoning used to govern which events **messaged**
the buyer; since `86eyd63r8` nothing messages them, so it now governs which
events move the **order status** their page reflects. The bar is the same one
and the answer didn't change.

**Why COMPLETED doesn't chime the vendor:** `delivered` is the expected
happy path — the inbox shows it reactively and the interruption budget
(chime + system notification) is reserved for events needing ACTION: new
order, failed booking. Payment is orthogonal: a delivered-but-unpaid order
(cash on hand-over, pay-later) stays `unpaid` and the buyer settles from
their order page ("How to pay" + "I've paid"); the automatic and manual
payment reminders that used to back this up are **gone** (`86eyd63r8` — see
[`payment-reminder.md`](./payment-reminder.md)), so chasing is the seller's
own message to send. The rider never collects money for us (Lalamove COD is
not enabled).

Terminal failures email the seller (EN+BM `deliveryJobFailed` template),
raise a browser alert on devices with order alerts on, leave the order
untouched, and the card offers one-tap rebook.

**Registration is per SELLER** (BYO-only): each vendor pastes OUR webhook
URL into THEIR Partner Portal → Developers → Webhook URL (Version 3). The
settings card surfaces the exact URL with a copy button and the vendor
guide walks it (Step E5). Graceful degradation if a seller skips it:
bookings still work, but shipped/delivered stop being automatic — the
order stays where it is until the seller advances it by hand, which since
3 Aug costs one confirm per transition while a booking is active (the
"Update manually" escape; see the manual-advance gate below). Dev
deployment URL: `https://qualified-chihuahua-441.convex.site/webhook/lalamove`.

**Manual-advance gate while the rider drives (26 Jul hotfix; tightened
3 Aug; server-enforced 14 Aug, ClickUp `86eydum6y`):** while an order has
an **ACTIVE** rider job, the order-detail stepper's advance into a
**shipped- or delivered-anchored** stage renders **disabled-with-reason**
— a manual tap would flip the buyer's order page to "on the way" before
the rider has the goods and, for shipped, without the live-tracking link
on it (pre-`86eyd63r8` it would also have fired a premature WhatsApp; the
page-only consequence is what remains). Confirm/packed advances are never
gated (pre-pickup work is the seller's), same-anchor custom-stage moves
stay free, and a **"Update manually" confirm-gated escape** stays
reachable so a dead webhook never strands the order (cancelling the
booking lifts the gate outright — a second way out).

The gate originally ALSO required `deliveryJobs.lastEventAt`, i.e. proof
the webhook was alive, so that webhook-less sellers kept manual control.
That left the gate **off during exactly the window it matters most** —
between placing the booking and the first event landing — and Zaki hit it
in live testing on 3 Aug: booked a rider, then clicked straight through to
"Collected" on a live trip. Since the escape already protects the
webhook-less seller, the `lastEventAt` condition was dropped; it now only
picks the honest wording ("moves on its own when the rider picks up" once
the booking has reported, vs "…as long as your Lalamove webhook is set
up" before that). Predicates: `isActiveJobStatus` +
`isRiderManagedTransition`; `riderDrivesOrderStatus` now only answers "has
this booking reported yet?" for copy.

**The gate is enforced server-side** (`riderOwnsTransition` in
`convex/orders.ts`) across all three seller entry points — `advanceToStage`
(the stepper), `updateStatus`, and the inbox's `bulkUpdateStatus` — with the
client-side rendering above kept purely as the UX affordance. The server
mirrors the client rule exactly: gated from the **moment of booking** (any
ACTIVE job; no `lastEventAt` requirement, per the 3 Aug reasoning above)
and **never on collection orders** — their rider drives the FRONT of the
flow, the webhook moves the job only, and the order stays the seller's to
advance by hand, so the gate would both lie and strand. That exclusion is
judged off the ORDER's frozen `deliveryDirection` (never the store's live
setting), so a mode switch can't re-gate or un-gate in-flight orders. The
stepper's "Update manually" confirm passes `overrideRiderGate: true`;
**bulk has no override** (whether a given order's automatic update failed
is a per-order judgement), so a rider-driven order is **skipped** and
counted in `skippedRiderManaged` — the inbox toast names the reason ("2
with a rider on the way"), same posture as the collection skip count.

Why server-side and not just UI: an early manual "shipped" is **permanent**,
not cosmetic. `applyStatusTransition` WhatsApps the buyer immediately, and
`SHIPPABLE_FROM` is `{confirmed, packed}` — so once the order reads
"shipped", the rider's real PICKED_UP event is skipped and
`carrierTrackingUrl` is never written. The buyer gets a shipped notice with
no tracking link and the webhook can never heal it. This closes the gap
previously logged here as "the inbox bulk status bar can still mass-mark
shipped without job awareness"; it's resolved in the mutation (one indexed
`by_order` read per order, and only once `isRiderManagedTransition` has
already ruled the anchor in) rather than by threading job state through
`searchOrders`. The collection gate below shares this posture: both are
server-enforced on every write path.

The gate reads the order's **ACTIVE** job row, not its first. An order
routinely holds several `deliveryJobs` rows — a failed booking's released row
is kept on purpose as the amber "failed" card, and `reserveBooking` then lets
the seller rebook — and `by_order` is indexed on `orderId` alone, so a
`.first()` would return the *oldest* row and read a rebooked order as
rider-free. Every `by_order` reader (`dispatchContextForOrder`,
`reserveBooking`, the cancel resolver, `dispatchStateForOrder`) therefore
`.collect()`s and picks on `isActiveJobStatus`; the gate follows suit.

### Hygiene + lifecycle guards (pre-ship audit, 22 Jul)

- `deleteOrderCascade` (hard delete) also removes the order's `deliveryJobs`
  rows; the delete dialog warns first when a booking is still ACTIVE (same
  warning as cancel — the rider still shows up unless cancelled on Lalamove).
- Account deletion cascades `deliveryJobs` + `deliveryQuotes` (new
  `by_retailer` index on quotes).
- Abandoned `deliveryQuotes` rows are purged daily
  (`purgeStaleCheckoutQuotes` cron, >24h old — far past the 30-min consume
  window).
- Buyer address edits are pending-only (`updateDeliveryAddress` guard), so an
  address can never change under an active rider booking — verified, not new.
- Webhook handler null-guards deleted/cancelled orders (acts on neither).
- Per-product fulfilment notice (`products.minNoticeDays`) raises the
  checkout date floor for made-to-order items — see
  docs/fulfilment-date.md; custom carts label the field "Requested date".
- Seller-side awareness: browser order alerts (new order + booking failed)
  — see docs/order-notifications.md.

## Collection service — Leg 1, rider collects FROM the buyer (86eyg0n8e)

Bearcamp (tent/gear cleaning) runs the trip in **reverse**: the rider picks
up at the **customer's address** and drops off at the seller's outlet. One
store-level switch flips the whole feature:
`retailers.deliveryBooking.deliveryDirection: "standard" | "collection"`
(undefined = standard — every existing seller; toggle lives in the Lalamove
settings section above prompt-on-packed). It sits on `deliveryBooking`, NOT
the ticket's `deliveryConfig.lalamove` arm, because pricing-mode switches
rebuild that arm wholesale while the booking object merges per-field
(`promptBookOnPacked` precedent) — so a month on Flat pricing and back can
never silently reset a collection store to standard. **Every branch is gated
on `=== "collection"`, so standard-direction stores are behaviourally
untouched.**

Three freezes, one setting:

- **`orders.deliveryDirection`** — stamped at create (pickupSnapshot
  posture) so buyer surfaces stay true if the store toggles later. Drives:
  checkout copy (section title "Collection address", "where should we
  collect from?" flavour intro, rider-fee expectation line, date question
  "When should we collect it?", fee lines "Collection"), the wa.me message
  ("🚚 Collect from:", "Collection fee:", "🗓️ Collect from me on:"), the
  WA confirm's method line ("We'll update you once collection from your
  address is arranged." EN/MS/ZH — packed/shipped/delivered defaults stay
  ship-flavoured on purpose: a collection store's real vocabulary is custom
  stages, e.g. collected → cleaning → ready), the tracking page ("Collect
  from", "Collection from your address", "We collect on", "Collection
  fee") and the seller order page ("Collect From"). The public slug payload
  carries the one-bit `deliveryCollectsFromCustomer` for checkout. **CSV is
  the deliberate exception**: the *Fulfilment* cell reads `collection`, but
  the header row is untouched (still "Delivery fee"). One export can hold
  both directions — a store that switched modes, and routinely once
  direction varies per order — so a per-row column NAME is impossible, and
  a seller's bookkeeping template keys on names. Value-level, not
  header-level.
- **`deliveryJobs.deliveryDirection`** — snapshotted at `reserveBooking` so
  the webhook obeys what was BOOKED, not the live setting.
- **Dispatch swap** — `dispatchContextForOrder` swaps stops AND contacts:
  origin/sender = buyer (same +60 fallback → seller number, buyer's real
  number in remarks), destination/recipient = the outlet. The checkout
  quote (`quoteForCheckout`) prices the same buyer→store direction (route
  prices aren't guaranteed symmetric), so buyer-paid fee and dispatch
  re-quote can't systematically drift.

**The webhook only moves the JOB on a collection booking.** `picked_up`
means "rider took the goods FROM the buyer" and `completed` means "they
reached the seller" — neither is shipped/delivered *to the customer*, so
order status stays the seller's to advance by hand (their custom stages
tell the story). Three side-channels are closed with it:

- **No `carrierTrackingUrl` mirror** (DRIVER_ASSIGNED + commitBooking): a
  later manual shipped-anchored advance would otherwise present the stale
  Leg-1 collection trip as shipment tracking. Instead the buyer gets the
  **live collection-rider strip** (3 Aug, Zaki's ask after first local
  test): while a job is ACTIVE, `orders.get` returns `collectionRider`
  (trip state, driver name + plate, Lalamove share link — never the
  driver's phone, cost or provider ids) and `/track` renders a transient
  card above the timeline ("Finding a rider…" → "{driver} is on the way to
  your address" + plate → "Collected — on the way to {store}"). It reads
  the live job row, so it can't go stale and vanishes the moment the trip
  ends — deliberately a strip, not a status: the order lifecycle stays the
  seller's. Verified against a real sandbox booking on dev.
- **POD photo is seller-only**: it shows the rider dropping the buyer's
  gear at the seller's own doorstep, so `fetchPodImages` skips the buyer
  WhatsApp follow-up and `orders.get` never exposes `podImageUrls` on
  collection orders (even after the seller manually marks delivered — the
  caption "taken by your rider at drop-off" would read as nonsense). The
  dispatch card keeps the thumbnails, labelled "kept for your records".
- **The manual-advance gate lifts** (`riderAutoUpdates` in order detail):
  the "moves to Shipped on its own" disabled-state would both lie and
  strand a collection seller. The mark-shipped rider prompt is also
  skipped — offering "book a rider" at the shipped moment would dispatch
  ANOTHER buyer→store collection; the return journey is **Leg 2, out of
  scope** (Bearcamp raises a separate order for it).
- **`orders.collectedAt`** — the webhook stamps WHEN the goods arrived (a
  timestamp, never a status change). It exists because a collection order's
  `fulfilmentDate` is the day the rider COLLECTS — the start of the seller's
  work, not a deadline — so the inbox/date badge would otherwise show red
  **"Overdue" for the entire healthy service window** on every collection
  order, and (being a strict priority list) would suppress every other
  contextual badge under it. Keyed on the goods arriving rather than on
  status, because a seller may anchor their own "Collected" stage at
  `confirmed`. Before collection a passed date still reads red — that
  genuinely means nothing came in. The same stamp gives the buyer a
  persistent "Collected on …" line once the live rider strip retires, so
  their page is never silent mid-service.
- **The seller cannot move a collection order until the goods arrive**
  (3 Aug, Zaki's second catch). On a collection order the rider brings the
  goods IN, so "packed" / "cleaning" / "ready" cannot be true beforehand —
  yet the stepper let him mark Packed with no rider even booked, and
  prompt-on-packed then offered to dispatch one, which is backwards
  (packing happens AFTER arrival). Now `isCollectionGateClosed`
  (`convex/lib/order.ts`, beside `isMockupGateClosed` and shaped like it)
  blocks every advance into a packed-or-later anchor while
  `deliveryDirection === "collection"` and `collectedAt` is unset.
  **Server-enforced on all three seller write paths** — `advanceToStage`
  and `updateStatus` throw, `bulkUpdateStatus` SKIPS (one ineligible order
  must not fail a batch, the mockup-gate posture) — with the stepper
  mirroring it as disabled-with-reason pointing at "Send rider to collect".
  Cancelling is never gated. The escape is **"I already have the items"**,
  for a seller who fetched them in person or whose webhook never reported:
  it rides `advanceToStage({ markCollected: true })`, which stamps
  `collectedAt` in the same transaction — so the question is asked once,
  not at every stage. **prompt-on-packed never fires on a collection
  order** and its ⚡ hint is hidden, since the promise it makes is one this
  flow must never keep. One-shot `orders:backfillCollectionCollectedAt`
  stamps orders whose rider completed before the field existed (dev only —
  production has no collection orders yet; ran on dev 3 Aug, 1 stamped).
  Standard delivery is untouched by construction: the predicate is false
  for every non-collection order (verified against all 130 dev orders).
- **A manual collection offers to cancel the rider** (4 Aug). Taking the
  "I already have the items" escape while a booking is still ACTIVE left the
  rider on their way to fetch goods the seller already had. The escape now
  warns up front ("we'll ask whether to cancel them next") and, once the
  collection is actually recorded, asks: *Cancel the rider booking?* It is
  **asked, never automatic** — Lalamove can charge once a driver is
  assigned, so the spend stays the seller's call — and it reuses the same
  `cancelBooking` action the dispatch card's own cancel button uses. Only
  the collection escape does this: a standard order's manual advance means
  the webhook was quiet, not that the rider is redundant.
- **A completed collection is TERMINAL for the card** (`collectionDone`,
  3 Aug — bug found by Zaki in local testing). Because the order never
  advances, it sits at confirmed/packed forever, so `bookable` stayed true
  and the card re-offered "Send rider to collect" after the goods had
  already arrived — a second, paid, pointless trip. Worse, the
  prompt-on-packed effect had the same hole: marking the collected order
  **Packed** (the natural next step in a wash workflow) would have
  AUTO-OPENED the booking dialog. Both are now stopped on
  collection + `job.status === "completed"`; a **failed** collection still
  offers Rebook (no rider ever came), and standard orders are untouched
  (they self-close by reaching `delivered`). The settled card answers the
  question that state raises — "how do I get it back to them?" — with the
  honest Leg-2 answer: book the return in your own Lalamove app, since a
  return order raised here would just be another collection.

Seller card copy flips throughout ("Lalamove Collection", "Send rider to
collect", pills Finding rider → Heading to customer → Collected → Arrived,
"Buyer paid for collection"). Pricing (`resolveDeliveryQuote`) is untouched
— distance is symmetric; `deliveryFeePending`, radius/flat modes and the
no-fee-pending-under-Lalamove rule all apply unchanged.

## Dispatch pickup-time picker — seller override (19 Aug 2026, ClickUp 86eyp5qd1)

The booking modal's schedule strip is now interactive. Before, the pickup
moment was **always** the buyer's fulfilment moment (`resolveScheduleAt` on
`requestedMoment`) with no way to book a different slot — the 3 AM advance
order left the vendor choosing between a 3 AM rider and no rider.

- **`prepareBooking.scheduleAtOverride`** (`number | "now"`, optional): a
  number = "come at this exact moment", `"now"` = dispatch immediately even
  though the buyer's moment is still ahead (goods ready early), omitted = the
  buyer's moment, byte-identical to before. Resolution is the pure
  `resolveDispatchSchedule` (convex/lib/lalamove.ts): the default and an
  explicit pick share `resolveScheduleAt`'s clamps (past/imminent → book now),
  with ONE asymmetry — an explicit pick beyond Lalamove's 30-day window is
  **refused with a message**, never silently degraded to an immediate booking
  (a rider right now is the opposite of what the seller just asked for; the
  buyer-derived default keeps its silent degrade since orders can't exceed
  +30d anyway). Quotes are bound to their `scheduleAt`, so every change
  re-quotes — the price is always for the trip actually being bought.
- **Modal UX**: the strip says whose time the trip is scheduled for ("the time
  the buyer asked for" vs "the time you picked") with a **Change time**
  toggle → date+time inputs + "Use this time" (re-quote) + "Send the rider
  now" + "Use the buyer's time instead" (reset). Override state fully resets
  on dialog close/confirm — a dismissed override can never leak into the next
  booking.
- **Promise-mismatch warning**: when an override makes the trip differ from a
  still-future buyer moment, an amber note says the order still promises the
  buyer the old time and points at **Reschedule** (order detail) *before*
  booking — deliberately before, because an active booking blocks the
  reschedule (frozen `quotationId`). The two features compose as
  *reschedule → book*; the dispatch override alone is for pickup-lead
  tweaks ("rider leaves 45 min before the promise") and send-now.
- `prepareBooking` also returns `buyerRequestedMoment` (the untouched buyer
  moment) so the modal can render that warning without a second read.
  `confirmBooking`/`deliveryJobs.scheduledAt` are unchanged — the override is
  already baked into the quote's `scheduledFor`.
- The seller-side reschedule of the ORDER's fulfilment moment (what the buyer
  sees) is `orders.rescheduleFulfilment` — see docs/fulfilment-date.md
  ("Seller reschedule"). Its hard guard: refused while a rider job is ACTIVE.

### Rebook path + order sync (canonical bug 86eyp63xn, Wagyu Walid)

- **Rebook auto-opens the time editor**: a failed/cancelled booking's schedule
  is stale by definition (that's why it failed), so "Rebook delivery" opens the
  modal with the date+time inputs already showing instead of hiding them behind
  "Change time" — Arif's AC1. **Past picks are refused client-side** (20 Aug
  follow-up): the native `min` only greys the picker — typed/stepped/seeded
  values below it still land in state and would silently degrade to an
  immediate booking (and offer the ORDER a past promise via the sync
  checkbox) — so "Use this time" validates `moment >= now` with an inline
  reason pointing at "Send the rider now", and the editor's prefill clamps a
  stale seed to today. Date input bounds `[today, +30d]`
  (MAX_NOTICE_DAYS); the buyer-facing `minNoticeDays` deliberately does NOT
  bind the seller (amended off the ticket — a store with 3 days' notice must
  still be able to rebook a failed delivery for tomorrow).
- **"Also update the delivery time the buyer sees" (AC2)**: once a moment is
  picked, a checkbox offers to move the ORDER to it. Confirm then runs
  `rescheduleFulfilment` **before** `confirmBooking` — the only order where
  both can move together, since an active job blocks the reschedule; a failed
  sync aborts the dispatch (booking a trip whose promise update was refused
  would recreate the exact mismatch this fixes). **Defaults**: ON when the
  order's moment is already past or a failed booking exists (the rebook path —
  the old time is wrong by definition), OFF when the buyer's moment is still
  ahead (a rider leaving earlier than the promise is legitimate and must never
  rewrite it silently). Never offered for "now" (an immediate dispatch is not
  a promise to write) or counter orders. With the box ticked the amber
  mismatch warning retires (the mismatch resolves itself at confirm); left
  unticked, the warning points at the box instead of a detour.

## Which environment am I in? (21 Aug 2026, ClickUp `86eypncfy`)

Lalamove issues `pk_test_…` (sandbox) and `pk_prod_…` (production) keys, and
`inferLalamoveEnv` has always routed each to its own API host. What it did NOT
do was tell anyone — the environment was derived on every call and discarded.

**Why that mattered.** Wagyu Walid was onboarded on 8 Aug with sandbox keys.
Nothing in the product said so, so for two weeks his live storefront quoted
buyers through Lalamove's **test environment** and charged those prices for
real (`ORD-W4AH`: RM27.40). His one "successful" booking was a simulated trip
no rider could ever run. When the sandbox's play-money wallet drained he got
`ERR_INSUFFICIENT_BALANCE`, our copy told him to *"top it up in the Lalamove
app"*, and he topped up a real wallet that the sandbox can never see — nine
failed attempts across 26 hours before he shipped the order by hand.

Diagnosing it needed a production dig, because the only stored trace of the
environment was the **host in `deliveryJobs.shareLink`**
(`share.sandbox.lalamove.com` vs `share.lalamove.com`) — and that exists only
on bookings that actually committed.

**Now:** `retailers.deliveryBooking.env` is stamped at save from the
**plaintext** key, exactly like `apiKeyHint` and HitPay's `mode`, and rides
`DeliveryBookingSummary` + `getDeliveryJob` to the UI.

- Stamped in `retailers.updateSettings` (stamp-on-type, keep-otherwise, cleared
  with the key) and by the backfill below.
- **Never derived from a stored value in a query.** A ciphertext doesn't start
  with `pk_test_`, so inferring post-encryption returns `"production"` for
  everyone — which would silently suppress the one warning this field exists
  for. `dispatchContextForOrder` and `getDeliveryJob` therefore read the
  stamped field, **not** `credentials.env`.
- `undefined` = a row the backfill hasn't reached. Rendered as **nothing** —
  never as a green "Live", because a false all-clear is the original bug.

**Surfaced at every point of spend**, not just Settings — a sandbox booking
looks identical to a real one right up until no rider arrives:

| Surface | What it says |
| --- | --- |
| Settings → Fulfilment | `Test keys` / `Live` chip beside the stored key, plus an amber block naming the consequence (simulated trips, buyers quoted test prices, wallet can't be topped up) |
| Dispatch card (order detail) | Amber "Test mode — no real rider" banner with the `pk_prod_` fix and a link back to Settings |
| Booking confirm dialog | Compact "Test keys — this dispatches a simulated trip" line, above the price |
| Booking failure copy | On sandbox, an insufficient-balance refusal explains the test wallet instead of asking for a top-up |

**Deliberately NOT blocked.** Sandbox keys on a production deployment are a
legitimate testing setup (Zaki uses them); this is a visibility problem, not an
authorisation one. Loud and unmissable, never refused.

### Backfill (one-shot, per deployment)

```bash
npx convex run credentials:backfillLalamoveEnv
```

**Must run wherever `credentials:encryptExistingCredentials` already ran** — by
the time `env` existed every prod row was ciphertext, so the encrypt backfill
can't stamp them (it only ever touched plaintext). This one decrypts each
stored key purely to read its prefix; the plaintext is never stored, logged or
returned. A key it can't decrypt leaves `env` unset rather than guessing.

### Booking errors are classified by id, not by body text

`friendlyBookingError` used to lowercase the whole response body and match
`"insufficient" | "balance" | "credit"` anywhere in it. Lalamove ships a
free-text `message` beside the machine-readable `id`, so any failure whose
wording happened to contain one of those words was reported as a wallet
problem — sending a seller to spend money that fixes nothing. It now goes
through `classifyBookingFailure`, keyed off the `id` (`parseLalamoveErrorCode`,
the same source `isOutOfServiceAreaError` already used). Text sniffing survives
only as a last resort for bodies with no parseable id (HTML error pages, socket
errors), and a *recognised* id we have no copy for stops at `"unknown"` rather
than falling through to guess.

### The dead quote — a failed confirm must not trap the seller

A quotation is valid for **exactly 5 minutes**. `handleConfirm` used to toast
the failure and return, leaving the dialog open on that quote — so the obvious
next move (press "Confirm & dispatch" again) re-sent an expired `quotationId`,
and the resulting copy pointed at a "Book delivery" button sitting *behind the
modal overlay*. Wagyu Walid pressed it five times in 5m23s against one
quotationId before giving up.

Fixed in `BookDeliveryCard`:

- The failure renders **inside** the dialog (a toast is gone before the seller
  returns from the Lalamove app) and states that nothing was charged.
- The primary action becomes **"Get a fresh price"** — an in-place re-quote —
  whenever a confirm has failed *or* the quote has lapsed. Dispatch is only
  offered while it can actually succeed.
- `prepareBooking` now returns the quotation's `expiresAt` (parsed all along,
  previously discarded); the dialog shows a live `Price locked for 4:32`
  countdown and falls back to its own 5-minute clock if the provider omits it.

### Dispatch can't be tapped by accident (21 Aug 2026, ClickUp `86eypjfuf`)

Reported as: a seller on a tablet reached the booking dialog mid-scroll and a
booking went out. **The reported mechanism doesn't hold** — worth recording so
the repro steps aren't chased again:

- A Motorcycle/Car tap calls `prepareBooking`, a **quote**. It writes no
  `deliveryJobs` row and spends nothing. `reserveBooking` — the only writer —
  is reached exclusively from `confirmBooking`, so every failed row is a real
  press of **Confirm & dispatch**.
- The nine attempts on `ORD-W4AH` are **10–23 seconds apart**. Scroll-slop taps
  fire in milliseconds; those gaps are a human retrying.
- Radix wraps the overlay in `RemoveScroll` and `DialogContent` is `fixed` /
  `overflow-hidden` with no `overflow-y-auto`, so **neither the page nor the
  dialog scrolls while it's open** — there is no gesture there to mistake for a
  tap.
- That store had `promptBookOnPacked: false`, so the auto-open path was never
  active on it.

What the seller actually hit was the dead-quote trap above: the modal stayed
open on a spent quotation and Confirm was the only visible action.

**The underlying concern is still real, and is now fixed.** "Confirm &
dispatch" spends from the seller's wallet on a single tap with no second step,
and the dialog *can* appear under a finger — `promptBookOnPacked` opens it on
the packed transition, and the stepper's `bookRequestToken` on a manual
advance. So the button **arms 600ms after it appears** (`SPEND_ARM_DELAY_MS`):

- Keyed on quote **presence**, not identity — it arms once when the button
  first appears and stays armed across vehicle/time re-quotes, so switching
  Motorcycle→Car never re-disables dispatch.
- Genuinely `disabled`, not an inert click handler: a button that silently
  swallows a real tap reads as broken.
- Deliberately **not** applied to Book delivery / Get a fresh price / the
  vehicle pills — those cost a quote, which is free.

Rejected: pointer-move scroll-vs-tap discrimination (it would guard a gesture
that can't happen, per the scroll-lock above) and hold-to-confirm (friction on
every seller's happy path for an accident the arm delay already covers).

## Markets — how Singapore gets riders (z8r3fdch3r)

**Lalamove serves Singapore.** Its REST API is segmented by a `Market` header
across 11+ markets and `SG` is one of them. SG sellers couldn't see rider
booking because of OUR gate, not their coverage — and the fit is better there
than here: Lalamove is intra-city, and in Singapore the city IS the country,
so it would cover every SG→SG delivery. That matters more than "one more
market", because Delyva SG turned out to be bring-your-own-courier with an
empty catalogue: **Lalamove is the Singapore delivery story, not Delyva.**

### The market is a property of the STORE

It used to be `LALAMOVE_MARKET = "MY"`, a module constant. It now resolves
from the store's country (`lalamoveMarketForCountry`) and **rides on the
credentials object**, because every call site already carries those — passing
it as a second argument through ten signatures would have been ten chances to
forget one, and a forgotten market silently prices the wrong country.

`resolveLalamoveCredentials(booking, country)` therefore takes the country as
a **required** argument. Deliberately no default: a default is exactly how a
new call site quietly bills a Singapore store against the Malaysian market.
Callers that only ask *"has this seller connected Lalamove"* — a question with
no market in it — use `hasLalamoveCredentials()` instead of inventing one.

### Phone numbers are per market

`toLalamoveContactPhone(phone, market)` replaced `toLalamoveMyPhone`; the
`My` in the old name was the bug. Lalamove validates the contact's AREA CODE
per market, so a foreign number is a 422 at booking time — returning `null`
routes dispatch to its fallback (seller's number as rider contact, buyer's in
the remarks). The old helper's test carried a warning that a future "accept
+65 everywhere" sweep would break real bookings; that warning still holds and
is honoured — **+65 is accepted in SG and still rejected in MY**, and the
mirror case (+60 in SG) now fails the same way. The Johor cross-border buyer
exists in both directions.

### Swept late: the quotation locale

The PR #255 review caught the one market-scoped field the sweep missed:
`language` in the v3 quotation body was hardcoded `en_MY`. Each market has
its own locale list (MY: `en_MY`/`ms_MY`; SG: `en_SG`) and a mismatch is a
422 — which `classifyQuoteFailure` has no branch for, so every SG quote
would have failed as a generic "unavailable". It now derives from the market
the request already carries (`MARKET_LANGUAGE`), with tests pinning both
markets.

### Verified NOT to need changing

- **Money.** SG quotes in SGD with **one** decimal place (`"10.5"`), and
  `lalamoveAmountToSen` already pads that to `1050` correctly. Checked before
  anything else was written, because "tidying" that padding is how you ship a
  ten-fold error.
- **Scheduling.** SG shares UTC+8 with Malaysia, so the `MYT`-named helpers
  (`NOON_MYT_OFFSET_MS`, `mytMidnightFromYmd`) are already correct for SG
  despite their names.

### The gate is OPEN (`COUNTRY_RIDER_BOOKING.SG = true`)

Every blocker was closed with evidence rather than a sandbox run, because no
SG sandbox account could be created (4 Sep, Zaki) and the ticket's whole point
is SG vendors using their live keys:

- **Service types**: Lalamove's own published SG catalogue
  (developers.lalamove.com, `specialRequests_Key_Update_2023_SG.pdf`) lists
  SG's API serviceTypes as `MOTORCYCLE`, `CAR`, `MINIVAN`, `MPV`, `VAN`,
  `TRUCK330`, `TRUCK550` — **both of ours appear verbatim**, so the hardcoded
  union cannot 422 an SG quote. (SG's Courier tier IS `MOTORCYCLE` in the
  API even though the app calls it "Courier".)
- **Money**: SGD's one-decimal amounts already parse (`"10.5"` → 1050).
- **Phones**: `toLalamoveContactPhone` accepts +65 in the SG market.
- **Timezone**: SG is UTC+8 — the MYT helpers hold.
- **Failure posture**: an SG store with a wrong setup gets a NAMED reason at
  every step (`no_seller_phone`, `out_of_range`, the market-neutral
  `bad_phone` copy), never a dead end — so a live-first vendor run degrades
  to a clear message, not a mystery.

What the flip changed on each surface: the Courier-booking row renders for SG
(same toggle as MY), `updateSettings` accepts enabling booking on an SG store,
`dispatchBlockReason` proceeds past the country check, and `bookingEnabled` /
`riderOnlyStore` read true where earned. Copy that named Malaysia
(`no_seller_phone`, the `bad_phone` booking failure, the SG mode-grid line)
is market-neutral now.

**Cross-market keys are the one new hazard.** Lalamove issues API keys per
market app, so a store that switches country keeps booking armed while its
stored keys belong to the old market — quotes then fail at the point of use.
The country-switch checklist's `delivery_booking` item now covers exactly
this (money severity, ACKABLE — we cannot see which market a stored key was
created for, so the seller confirms), and the switch dialog warns in the same
sentence.

**Still genuinely unverified: one live SG booking end to end.** The first SG
vendor run is the verification. If anything surprises, it will surface as a
named quote/booking failure on their dispatch card — collect the message and
it locates the layer immediately. `COUNTRY_DELIVERY_MODES.SG` gaining
`"live"` pricing waits for z8r3fdbvdy to merge (one line there).

## Sandbox E2E — verified 21 Jul 2026

Real sandbox pass with test keys (then platform-env-based; the same keys
now simply live on a retailer row as BYO): webhook URL registered via API → quote
(KLCC→PJ, RM13.30 → 1330 sen, stopIds, 18.3 km) → order placed (shareLink
returned at create, status `ASSIGNING_DRIVER`) → GET → cancel (204). All
request signing accepted first try; webhook events landed at the dev route
and verified under the `data` variant. Remaining before prod: driver-status
progression (sandbox has no riders — `PICKED_UP`/`COMPLETED` paths are
covered by hand-signed-payload tests in `convex/lalamove.test.ts`; first
prod booking is the live confirmation), and Fruit Hut's own account: Naim
registers, tops up his wallet, pastes his `pk_prod_` keys into Settings →
Fulfilment and registers the prod webhook URL in his Partner Portal
(Arif walks him through it — subtask `86eyb5w24`; the vendor guide is the
handout).

## Local testing — driving a booking through its lifecycle

Lalamove's sandbox never dispatches a rider, so `PICKED_UP` / `COMPLETED`
(and our `shipped` / `delivered` auto-transitions) never fire naturally.
`scripts/lalamove-simulate-webhook.mjs` replays a **signed** webhook to your
deployment so you can walk a booking forward by hand. It's **sandbox-only**
— it refuses to run unless `LALAMOVE_API_KEY` is a `pk_test_…` key, so it
can never touch production.

Supply the same sandbox key/secret the test store has saved (the signature
must match what the webhook route verifies) via `--key`/`--secret` flags or
env vars, then pass the booking's `deliveryJobs.providerOrderId` (Convex
dashboard → Data → `deliveryJobs`):

```bash
# after tapping "Book delivery" on a confirmed delivery order:
node --env-file=.env.local scripts/lalamove-simulate-webhook.mjs <providerOrderId> driver \
  --key pk_test_xxxx --secret sk_test_xxxx
# then: ON_GOING → PICKED_UP (order → shipped) → COMPLETED (order → delivered)
```

Failure paths: `CANCELED` / `EXPIRED` / `REJECTED` (job fails + one-tap
rebook); `POD` fires the proof-of-delivery trigger (sandbox has no rider
photo, so the fetch comes back empty — the photo path is a
first-prod-booking check). `PICKED_UP` / `COMPLETED` move the real order, so
watch the buyer's order page and the inbox — they no longer send the buyer
anything (`86eyd63r8`).

To actually see the **POD photo** on both its surfaces (the buyer's order
page, the vendor card) without a real rider, inject a stand-in through the
same pipeline — no Lalamove credentials needed:

```bash
npx convex run lalamove:devInjectPodImage '{"providerOrderId":"<providerOrderId>"}'
```

Full step table, credential rules + the POD injector: [`dev-scripts.md`](./dev-scripts.md).

## Follow-ups (named, not built)

- Low-balance banner from `WALLET_BALANCE_CHANGED` (store last-known
  balance, warn before a booking ever fails).
- Prompt to cancel the Lalamove job inside the order-cancel flow (today the
  job card's cancel button is the path).
- Multi-outlet origin (per-dispatch origin picker) — dispatch already reads
  the origin from one resolver point.
- DelyvaX as provider #2 (parcel couriers / courier choice).
- Vendor onboarding guide (PDF): drafted with real Partner Portal
  screenshots; finalize once Kedaipal-side settings screenshots exist.
- Collection Leg 2 (return journey after the seller's work) — today a
  separate manual order; a "book return trip" that clones the order with
  the direction flipped is the natural v2.
- Per-product collection flag for mixed catalogs (a store selling goods
  AND a collection service): `products.collectionService` constrains the
  cart (no mixing directions in one order — one order = one trip) and
  `orders.deliveryDirection` derives from the items instead of the store
  toggle. Everything at the order/job layer is already direction-keyed, so
  this slots in without rework. Tracked in ClickUp; build when the first
  real mixed-catalog seller appears.
